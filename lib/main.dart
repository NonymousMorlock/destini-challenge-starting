// flatbutton has been removed from flutter, but this lesson depends on flatbutton,
// if you type FlatButton, you will get an error saying it's deprecated and no longer a part of flutter
// so i created a new flatbutton, so you can follow along with the challenge
// so when you see FlatButto(m) in the code, you can simply ignore it and know
// it's FlatButton but just one i created for this course since the original
// no longer works
// if you look in your lib folder, you'll also see flatbutton.dart, that is the widget i created
// so here i've imported it, so you can use it
// you can delete all these comments after you read them, so it doesn't distract you from the lesson
